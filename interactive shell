Spawning a TTY Shell
Peleus

Often during pen tests you may obtain a shell without having tty, yet wish to interact further with the system. Here are some commands which will allow you to spawn a tty shell. Obviously some of this will depend on the system environment and installed packages.

Shell Spawning
PYTHON
	python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
	
BASH
	echo os.system('/bin/bash')
	/bin/sh -i
	
PERL
	perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
	perl: exec "/bin/sh";
	
RUBY
	ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
	
LUA
	lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
	
(From within IRB)
exec "/bin/sh"

(From within vi)
:!bash

(From within vi)
:set shell=/bin/bash:shell

(From within nmap)
!sh

Many of these will also allow you to escape jail shells. The top 3 would be my most successful in general for spawning from the command line
